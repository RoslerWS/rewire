# Rewire Common
> Used by the various libraries that make up [rewire](https://github.com/WorkSight/rewire).

Typescript
----------
All rewire components are written with typescript and the source is always published into npm as part of the distribution. To get the most of out of rewire it is recommended that you reference the source files directly in your projects. This gives you the most flexibility when it come to intellisense, tree shaking, bundling and minification.

Installation
------------

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rewire-common):

	$ npm install rewire-common --save


Then, using a module bundler that supports either CommonJS or ES2015 modules, such as [fuse-box](https://fuse-box.org).
